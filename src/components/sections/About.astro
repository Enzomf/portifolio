        Hello, my name is Enzo Morais Figueiredo. I am currently pursuing a
        degree in <span class="text-secondary">IT Management</span> at FATEC of São
        Sebastião, with a strong focus on web development. My technical skills include
        proficiency in <span class="text-secondary">React</span>,
        <span class="text-secondary">Node</span> and
        <span class="text-secondary">TypeScript</span>, and I have a keen
        interest in <span class="text-secondary"
          >Test-Driven Development (TDD)</span
        > and
        <span class="text-secondary">Clean Architecture</span>. I have honed
        these skills through a mix of personal endeavors and academic projects,
        developing a holistic approach to software development. Alongside my
        technical abilities, I excel in teamwork and communication. As a
        dedicated and forward-thinking professional, I am always eager to
        embrace new challenges and stay in sync with the latest technological
        advancements. My goal is to contribute significantly to an organization
        by creating innovative technology solutions that align with client
        needs.
